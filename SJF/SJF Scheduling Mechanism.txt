AIM:-
Write a C Program to Implement the process scheduling mechanism as SJF


ALGORITHM:-
Step 1:- Start the process.
Step 2:- Accept the number of process in the ready Queue.
Step 3:- For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU Burst time.
Step 4:- Arrange the ready Queue according the shortest Burst time by sorting according to lowest to highest Burst time.
Step 5:- Set the Waiting time of the first process as '0' and its Turnaround time as its Burst time.
Step 6:- For each process in the ready Q, Calculate
		(a) Waiting time for process(n) = waiting time of process(n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
		(b) Turnaround time for process(n) = Waiting time of process(n) + Burst time of process(n)
Step 7:- Calculate
		(a) Average Waiting time = Total Waiting time / Number of process
		(b) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround time / Number of process
Step 8:- Stop the process.


Program:-
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int bt[20], P[20], wt[20], tat[20], i, j, n, total=0, Pos, temp;
	float avg_wt, avg_tat;
	printf("Enter number of process: ");
	scanf("%d", &n);
	printf("\n Enter Burst time: \n");
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		printf("P %d: ", i+1);
		scanf("%d", &bt[i]);
		P[i] = i+1;
	}
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		Pos=i;
		for(j=i+1;j<n;j++)
		{
			if(bt[j]<bt[Pos])
			Pos=j;
		}
		temp = bt[i];
		bt[i] = bt[Pos];
		bt[Pos] = temp;
		temp = P[i];
		P[i] = P[Pos];
		P[Pos] = temp;
	}
	wt[0]=0;
	for(i=1;i<n;i++)
	{
		wt[i]=0;
		for(j=0;j<i;j++)
		wt[i] += bt[j];
		total += wt[i];
	}
	avg_wt = (float)total / n;
	total = 0;
	printf("\n \t Process \t Burst time \t Waiting time \t Turnaround time");
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		tat[i] = bt[i] + wt[i];
		total += tat[i];
		printf("\n P%d %d %d %d ", P[i], bt[i], wt[i], tat[i]);
	}
	avg_tat = (float)total / n;
	printf("\n Average Waiting time = %f", avg_wt);
	printf("\n Average Turnaround time = %f", avg_tat);
	return 0;
}


Output:-
Enter number of Process: 3

Enter Burst time:
P1 = 33
P2 = 2
P3 = 1

Process	Burst time		Waiting time	Turnaround time
P3		1			0			1
P2		2			1			3
P1		33			3			6

Average Waiting time = 1.33333
Average Turnaround time = 13.33333
